#### Bringing the Global, local!

## Description

The Geoverse is a nod to the '90s Geo-cities. In a world over-saturated with social media, we've tried to bring a modern spin to an old classic, that focuses more on where we are, and our shared interests.

It utilises a range of npm packages to highlight the wide berth of skills in full stack development which have been learned, to bring a functional, and hosted full stack app. We have combined a MySQL and NoSQL approach to deliver a content sharing and user interaction service with direct messages, live wall posting (future development pending) and a collection of user made HTML pages to share and search for in Geoverse.
